  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

  <p>
    Crafty Flips is a personal developer tool that runs locally on your machine.
    This privacy policy explains how the tool handles data when you use it.
  </p>

  <h3>Information Collection and Storage</h3>
  <p>
    Crafty Flips does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.
    All data is stored locally on your machine in a SQLite database file.
  </p>

  <h3>OAuth & Platform API Access</h3>
  <p>
    When you configure Crafty Flips to connect with social media platforms (YouTube, Facebook,
    Instagram, TikTok), you provide OAuth access tokens or API credentials. These credentials:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are stored locally in your config.json file on your machine</li>
    <li>Are used solely to perform actions you explicitly request (uploading videos, fetching analytics)</li>
    <li>Are never transmitted to any third-party servers except the respective platform APIs</li>
    <li>Are your responsibility to keep secure (standard file permissions apply)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Third-Party Platform Integrations</h3>
  <p>
    When you use Crafty Flips to upload content or fetch analytics from platforms like TikTok,
    YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram, those platforms may collect data according to their own
    privacy policies. Crafty Flips only acts as an intermediary tool executing your commands.
  </p>

  <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
  <p>
    The tool stores the following data locally on your machine:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Video metadata (titles, descriptions, file paths)</li>
    <li>Upload records and scheduling information</li>
    <li>Analytics data fetched from platform APIs</li>
    <li>Platform credentials (in config.json)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
  <p>
    Crafty Flips does not share, sell, or distribute any data. The tool operates entirely
    on your local machine and only communicates directly with platform APIs you configure.
  </p>

  <h3>Security Recommendations</h3>
  <p>
    Since this is a local tool, security is your responsibility:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Protect your config.json file with appropriate file permissions</li>
    <li>Do not commit credentials to version control systems</li>
    <li>Regularly rotate API tokens and access credentials</li>
    <li>Keep your local machine secure with standard security practices</li>
  </ul>
